# Correlation Analysis

Codes that support exploration of the correlations between
genomes.

- correlation\_group.py - Groups formed by mutations because they have the same correlations with other mutations.
- depvar\_group.py - Grouping of mutations because of similar values of dependent variables
- genome\_correlation.py - Provides correlations between genomes
- mutation\_cooccurrence.py - Identifies co-occurring mutations for a collection of isolates
- mutation\_collection.py - A grouping of mutations based on the mutations co-occurring in the same isolates
