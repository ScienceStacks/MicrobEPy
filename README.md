# MicrobEPy (Pronounced "microbe pie")

Python package for analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of microbial communities.

This package provides python tools for analyzing the evolution of microbial communities in support of two research questions:
1. How do genomes change over time?
1. How does genotype affect phenotype?

The core concepts used in this analysis are:
- Mutation. A change in the reference genome including SNPs and INDELs.
- Community. The collection of genomes present, possibility from more than one species.
- Culture. The environment in which a community is grown and the phenotypes that are result.

## Usage Notes
1. The project is intended to be used as a git submodule.
1. The "project directory" refers to the folder containing this repository.
